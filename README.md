# Twitter-Traveloka-Dataset
This dataset contains 1.200 tweets that are related to Traveloka which are labeled into two labels: negative and positive sentiments.

# Formats
The file starts with a header and each following line consists of tweet followed by its respective label that are separated by a pipe ( | )

Inside the the text, we used quote (" ") to avoid column seperation.

# Which dataset should I use?
We recommend using the data_traveloka_fix as the other two files are just test files and not meant to be used.
